# 5servoMotor
First task of Electronics and Power Department for Smart Methods

The circuit designed to control 5 Servo motors of robotic arm in 2 ways.

The first project components: Arduino Uno R3, Positional Micro Servo (5). This circuit automaticaly moving from 0 to 90 degree then moving from 90 to 0 degree.

The second project components: Arduino Uno R3, Positional Micro Servo (5), 20 kâ„¦ Potentiometer (5). This circuit controled by Potentiometer from 0 to 90 degree.
